                                For your words could speak, <br>
                                with ease and finesse, <br>
                                a subtle rhythm, <br>
                                of sounding space, <br>
                                that only you and I can hear. <br> <br>

                                how the emotions, <br>
                                trickle-down, <br>
                                words by words, <br>
                                phrase by phrase. <br> <br>

                                but do not whisper, <br>
                                the empty air, <br>
                                as your wind, <br>
                                has the warmth, <br>
                                to invade my deafening beat. <br> <br>

                                So let me sink, <br>
                                in the sea you say, <br>
                                your unsung chord, <br>
                                that let me stay. <br> <br>

                                I want to see, <br>

                                that escapes your lips, <br>
                                with a tender hi!  <br>
                                Sing me a song, <br>
                                Will You?
